"""Classic Ludo rules engine (spec Section 6), kept as plain functions with no
database access — everything here just works on ints/lists so it's easy to reason
about and test in isolation. The routes in routes/gameplay.py do the DB reads/
writes and call into this module for "is this legal" / "what happens now".

Board coordinate scheme, per token:
  -1        = home yard, not yet on the board
  0-50      = on the shared 51-square outer track. A color-relative step number;
              GLOBAL_SQUARE() below converts it to one of the 52 squares on the
              physical board, using each color's own entry point.
  51-56     = in this color's private home column (6 squares, never shared,
              never captured). 56 is the final square — reaching it finishes
              the token.
